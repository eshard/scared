scared is a side-channel analysis framework.

## Getting started

### Pre-requisites

To use scared, you will need the the following Python **3.6** or **3.7**.

If your configuration has a binary build available ([see list here](#binary-builds-available)), you can just run:

```bash
pip install scared
```

```bash
conda install -c eshard scared
```

If your system isn't yet supported ([build contributions are welcome!](./CONTRIBUTING.md#building-for-conda)), or you want to build from source or develop, you'll also need:

- setuptools **0.40 or greater** (just run `pip install -U pip setuptools`)
- a C compiler to compile C extension

To install from source, you just need to run:

```bash
pip install .
```

from the source folder.

### Make a first cool thing

Start using scared by doing a cool thing:

```python
# First import the lib
import scared

# Define a selection function
@scared.attack_selection_function
def first_add_key(plaintext, guesses):
    res = np.empty((plaintext.shape[0], len(guesses), plaintext.shape[1]), dtype='uint8')
    for i, guess in enumerate(guesses):
        res[:, i, :] = np.bitwise_xor(plaintext, guess)
    return res

# Create an analysis CPA
a = scared.CPAAttack(
        selection_function=first_add_key,
        model=scared.HammingWeight(),
        discriminant=scared.maxabs)

# Load some traces, for example a dpa v2 subset
ths = scared.traces.read_ths_from_ets('dpa_v2.ets')

# Create a container for your ths
container = scared.Container(ths)

# Run!
a.run(container)
```
