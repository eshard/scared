# Trace sets

scared is *side-channel* analysis library. As such, managing, analysing and handling your samples and their corresponding metadata, is a central feature. `scared` provides the [`estraces`](https://eshard.gitlab.io/estraces/) library to manipulate trace sets, under the namespace `scared.traces`.

We present here the basic concepts and abstractions underlying used in `scared` for handling trace sets.

## The TraceHeaderSet abstractions

The class `TraceHeaderSet` is the central concept when manipulating traces in `scared`. Basically, a `TraceHeaderSet` instance provides attributes to manipulate traces samples and metadata with a common API, whatever is the underlying storage.

The main attributes of `TraceHeaderSet` are:

- `samples` is a `Samples` instance. It is a wrapper around the array of the traces samples.
- `metadatas` is a `Metadatas` instance. It is a mapping (dict-like) which wraps access to the traces metadata (`plaintext`, `ciphertext` for example).
- `headers` is a `Header` instance, which is a mapping to global metadata of the trace set, *aka* values which are common to all the traces.
- `traces` is a collection of `Trace` instance. Through these instances, you can manipulate each trace and its metadata one-by-one if needed

`TraceHeaderSet` also supports slicing and iterable interface. Slicing or indexing a `TraceHeaderSet` instance returns a new `TraceHeaderSet` instance (or a `Trace` instance), and iterating over will returns `Trace` instance.

In practical, user will never manipulate `TraceHeaderSet` instance, but rather instances bases on classes inheriting from `TraceHeaderSet`, and dynamically generated on the basis of the data source involved.

It allows to provide attribute-style access to any metadatas of the trace set, both on `TraceHeaderSet` and `Trace` instances.

For example, if you have a metadata `plaintext`, you can read it both by `ths.metadatas['plaintext']` and `ths.plaintext`.

For this usage, a factory function is provided, which takes care for you of all the underlying construction: `build_trace_header_set`. It takes a `Reader` instance as parameter and returns an initialized instance of a `TraceHeaderSet` sub-class based on the reader instance you provided.

## Readers and formats

Reader (or formats) classes are responsible for managing all the concrete manipulation of data, from the actual storage to the trace header set API.

A concrete reader class must inherit from `estraces.AbstractReader` base class. The `AbstractReader` class defines the basic contract that a reader class must fulfilled to be compatible and be used with the `TraceHeaderSet` abstraction.

The most important points of this contract (not the only ones !) are:

- provide methods to retrieve samples, metadatas and headers from the data storage, through the `fetch_samples`, `fetch_metadatas` and `fetch_headers` methods
- fulfill indexing contract, aka a `__getitem__` implementation

The resulting class is responsible for reading data in the storage. Most of optimisations, caching strategy, ... can be managed at this level.

`scared` provides several formats:

- binary formats, with one file per trace. This reader is pretty versatile, and can be used to read almost any binary format where there is one file per trace.
- trs file from Riscure formats
- sqlite reader, which can be used to read trace from a SQLite table
- ETS file, which is a file format based on H5, defined by eshard
- RAM reader, which allows to simply create trace header set instances from any in-memory data

To simplify the usage for user, a factory method `read_ths_from...` is provided for every format, abstracting most of the underlying mechanism.

If you intend to develop your own format, you should also implement helpers function to help the user.

### ETS format

The ETS file format use H5 to store traces, metadatas and headers in one file. The specification is rather simple, and is documented by the `ETSWriter` class. You can create an ETS file from any trace header set instance with the `ETSWriter`.
