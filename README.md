scared is a side-channel analysis framework.

## Getting started

### Requirements

Scared need python **3.6**, **3.7** or **3.8**.

You can install `scared`, depending on your setup:

- from source
- with `pip`
- with `conda`

>At time of writing, we highly recommend to install `scared` with `conda` if you want to use it with **python 3.8**

#### Install with `conda`

Conda builds are available for `linux-x64` and `osx-64` platforms.
If your system isn't yet supported, [build contributions are welcome!](./CONTRIBUTING.md#building-for-conda)).

You just have to run:

```bash
conda install -c eshard scared
```

#### Install with `pip`

Binary builds are available from Pypi for most Linux platforms and OS X. If your environment has a binary build available, just run:

```bash
pip install scared
```

If no wheel is available for your setup, you'll also need:

- setuptools **0.40 or greater** (just run `pip install -U pip setuptools`)
- a C compiler to compile C extension
- for **Python 3.8** only, a `llvmlite` working installation (see [install from source documentation](https://llvmlite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/admin-guide/install.html#building-manually))

and then run `pip install scared`.

#### Install from source

To install from source, you will need:

- setuptools **0.40 or greater** (just run `pip install -U pip setuptools`)
- a C compiler to compile C extension
- for **Python 3.8** only, a `llvmlite` working installation (see [install from source documentation](https://llvmlite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/admin-guide/install.html#building-manually), or install it with `conda`)

You need to run:

```bash
pip install .
```

from the source folder.

If you are planning to contribute, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) to install the library in development mode and run the test suite.

### Make a first cool thing

Start using scared by doing a cool thing:

```python
# First import the lib
import scared
import numpy as np

# Define a selection function
@scared.attack_selection_function
def first_add_key(plaintext, guesses):
    res = np.empty((plaintext.shape[0], len(guesses), plaintext.shape[1]), dtype='uint8')
    for i, guess in enumerate(guesses):
        res[:, i, :] = np.bitwise_xor(plaintext, guess)
    return res

# Create an analysis CPA
a = scared.CPAAttack(
        selection_function=first_add_key,
        model=scared.HammingWeight(),
        discriminant=scared.maxabs)

# Load some traces, for example a dpa v2 subset
ths = scared.traces.read_ths_from_ets_file('dpa_v2.ets')

# Create a container for your ths
container = scared.Container(ths)

# Run!
a.run(container)
```
